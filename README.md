# Browser-Kids-Safety

Our current population of India is about 150 crores, and where 60% are youths, which means 60% active brains or intellectuals  ðŸ§  but currently one of the reasons why those active brains are not working properly is pornography which has made almost 90% of youths addicted, where  USA is the first place in the world for porn exporters, and the other hand We Indians have ranked first for its import . although it is not possible to stop it with technology, especially for those who are already addicted, but we can try to protect those who are not yet addicted with our bad elements of  technology.
 So I am  going to   introduc my new "Browser Kids Safety" chrome extension through which you can let your kids use your personal computer or laptop without fear. We are now maintaining a static website list which will automatically block around 1000+ top porn websites. it Can use Personal laptop or Desktop.
